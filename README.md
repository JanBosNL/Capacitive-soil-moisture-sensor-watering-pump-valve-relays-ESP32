Some code that has been automaticly watering my plants succesfully the last few months.

I kept forgetting my peppers, tomatoes and wild garlic plants during the dry Dutch summers lately. So I came up with an idear. Bought mysel a perfect 110-liter wooden barrel that is connected to my rain pipe, and threw in some hardware. And its been working very well with a tiny amount of code. 

I want to build this to a balcony habitat management sensory system. Sort of an Webinterface with gui and statistics where I can eventually connect multiple other sensors to create a wheather station, and reference that with my automated plant watering needs giving me insight in my data through a web interface that shows statistics and current measurements from all the sensors connected to this diy system.
